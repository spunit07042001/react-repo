## components in react js


component is a reusable piece of code that represents a part of the user interface.Components can be thought of as custom HTML elements, and they can be either class-based or function-based.They allow you to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.

 There are two main types of components in React:

Functional Components: These are simple JavaScript functions that accept props as an argument and return React elements. They are stateless and do not have lifecycle methods.

 Class Components: These are ES6 classes that extend from React.Component and have a render method that returns React elements. They can have state and lifecycle methods.
